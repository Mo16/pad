            2500 entities have been discovered upon PADs
            entry into the Waystation who’s origin cannot seem to be accounted
            for. Whilst they share similar traits to the Evolved Collection,
            these beings share no link to our current world and seem wholly
            imbedded within this new psychedelic realm. After accidentally
            falling through the portal that led him to the discovery of the
            celestial Waystation, Hunter Ape Thompson called upon the entire
            Psychonaut Ape Division to join him on on his kaleidoscopic
            pilgrimage to this transformative dimension. During this journey it
            is believed that certain traits from our evolving PAD’s “split” from
            their very being and coalesced within the psychotropic ether to give
            rise to The Fractured Collection. The Fractured are 2500 psychedelic
            beings who are a combination of Evolved PAD DNA as well as new
            traits birthed solely from this new world. Will they integrate and
            live harmoniously alongside our Evolved PADs only time will tell…
